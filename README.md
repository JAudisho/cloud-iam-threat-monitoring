# Cloud IAM Threat Monitoring System

A Python-based AWS IAM monitoring tool that detects:

- Inactive IAM users for 30+ days
- Roles with newly attached AdministratorAccess policies
- Roles with wildcard ("*:*") permissions — a key privilege escalation risk

It sends alerts via Amazon SNS and generates CSV reports for auditing.
